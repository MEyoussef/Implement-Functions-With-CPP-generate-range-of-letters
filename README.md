/**
 * @brief Generates a string containing all the characters between two given characters.
 *
 * This function generates a string containing all the characters between two given
 * characters. The function assumes that the input characters are ASCII characters.
 * If the first character is greater than the second character, the function generates
 * the range from the second character to the first character. If the first character is
 * less than or equal to the second character, the function generates the range from the
 * first character to the second character.
 *
 * @param L1 The first character.
 * @param L2 The second character.
 *
 * @return A string containing all the characters between L1 and L2.
 *
 * @throws std::logic_error if L1 or L2 is not a valid ASCII character.
